# Explanation
#     Type will be used to show the commit type
#     Scope is just the scope of the change. Something like (admin) or (teacher).
#     Subject should use impertivite tone and say what you did.
#     Body should go into detail about changes made.
#     Footer should contain any JIRA (or other tool) issue references or actions.

# Type can be 
#     feat     (new feature)
#     fix      (bug fix)
#     refactor (refactoring production code)
#     style    (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change)
#     docs     (changes to documentation)
#     test     (adding or refactoring tests; no production code change)

# --------------------
# Remember to
#     Capitalize the subject line
#     Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#     Do not end the subject line with a period
#     Separate subject from body with a blank line
#     Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#     Can use multiple lines with "-" for bullet points in body
